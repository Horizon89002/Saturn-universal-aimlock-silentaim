Saturn_V1  is a fully open sourced, very advanced  aimlock and silent aim script
that is undetected in every game.

Made with the Linora UI library

the aimlock and other functionalities will work in every game BUT the silent aim
will work in anygame that uses Raycasting

i have personally tested the silent aim in games such as

Big Paintball, arsenal,  Bad Business, Prison life

and the silent aim worked perfectly

NOTE:  if it doesnt work try switching the methods of silent aims

futures:

Team check
Visible Check
